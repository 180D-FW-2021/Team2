Ensure your arms are in frame, even when jumping. Best performance is when you are 1-3 ft from your webcam. Also, make sure you are not swapping too quickly between movements. After a failed attempt, wait around a 1-2 seconds before re-attempting the movement.

| Light jumps are acceptable when 1-3 ft from the camera. Ensure to not duck too much before jumping, as this will be recognized as a duck instead of jump. | Small ducks are also acceptable, given you are 1-3 ft from the camera. Quick ducks are more recognizable than slow ducks. |

## Download the Game

The Unity and Movenet executables are downloadable [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vBoH45YPad5u9VueUC_M-a9Gt_FOG-vU?usp=sharing). Currently supported platforms are MacOS 64-bit and Windows 10 64-bit. If these do not work for you, you can compile the code from source using the "Compilation" instructions in the next section.

Note: when running the executable, you may have to disable some security permissions. For Mac, see [this](https://forum.unity.com/threads/the-application-cannot-be-opened.404388/) for debugging help.

To set up the Rpi controller, follow the raspberry pi instructions.

## Raspberry Pi

1. SSH into raspberry pi

   ```
   $ ssh pi@raspberrypi.local
   ```

2. Install all dependencies on raspberry pi

   ```
   $ pip install paho-mqtt
   $ pip install numpy
   ```

3. Replace `your_username` with the username you sign into Unity with

   ```
   $ cd IMU
   $ echo -e "[UserConfig]\nUsername=your_username" > config.ini
   ```

4. Startup Script for Raspberry Pi

   ```
   $ vim .bashrc
   ```

   At the bottom of the file, add the following:

   ```
   $ sudo python IMU/berryIMU.py
   ```

   Note: If you have the repository in a different directory, please update the path above.
   To save in vim, press the following: ESC-:wq.

5. Reboot Raspberry Pi

   ```
   sudo shutdown -r now
   ```

   After you SSH into the raspberry pi again, the startup script will run.

## Compilation

If you cannot download our executables, you can clone our source code and compile it yourself.

### Create Build Directory Structure

To use our automated scripts and ensure proper relative paths, you will need to make sure you have created the proper directory structure at the root of the project repo. The structure is as follows:

```
Team2
--| Build
----| Movenet
------ models/*
------ dist/*
----| Unity
------ MazeProject.exe
```

Make the directory at the root of the project, and copy the models from `Movenet/models` to `Build/Movenet/models`.

### Unity

1. Download [Unity Hub](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download).

2. Within Unity Hub, install Unity Editor version 2018.4.36f1. We recommend you use this version to ensure cross-compatability.

3. Within Unity Hub, choose "Open" -> "Add project from disk" -> select Unity subdirectory of this project.

4. [Build](https://docs.unity3d.com/2018.4/Documentation/Manual/PublishingBuilds.html) the game executable.

### Movenet

1. Download [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)
2. Download dependencies.

   ```
   $ cd Setup_Scripts
   $ pip install -r movenet_requirements.txt
   ```

3. Build

   ```
   $ cd Setup_Scripts
   # For windows, open build_movenet.bat in cmd prompt instead
   $ ./build_movenet
   ```
