### Web Cam

Ensure your arms are in frame, even when jumping. Best performance is when you are 1-3 ft from your webcam.

1. Jump

Light jumps are acceptable when 1-3 ft from the camera. Ensure to not duck too much before jumping, as this will be recognized as a duck instead of jump.

2. Duck

Small ducks are also acceptable, given you are 1-3 ft from the camera. Quick ducks are more recognizable than slow ducks.

## Development

Set up your development environment.

### Installation

First, download our tech stack:

1. [Unity](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download)
2. [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
3. [Raspberry Pi Zero](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/zero-wh/)

In addition, we recommend you install [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) and [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html). We also recommend you [create a virtual environment](https://uoa-eresearch.github.io/eresearch-cookbook/recipe/2014/11/20/conda/) for this project. Later instructions (including our Windows LaunchGame.bat script) assume you have initialized a virtual environment $yourenvname.

#### Movenet

Install python dependencies for Movenet.

```
$ conda activate $yourenvname
# ensure you have pip
$ conda install pip
# install dependencies
$ cd Setup_Scripts
$ pip install -r movenet_requirements.txt
$ conda deactivate
```

Run the movement detection script:

```
$ cd Movenet/src
$ python3 position_tracking.py
```

You can also follow installation instructions in **Movenet/README.md** if this does not work for you.

#### Raspberry Pi

### Run the Game

We have provided scripts to automatically open the game and Movenet position tracking concurrently. Scripts are located in the **Setup_Scripts** directory.

Prior to running the scripts, make sure you have properly installed python3 and have set up your virtual conda environment.

Also, ensure you [build your game executable](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/PublishingBuilds.html).

#### Windows

For Windows, a **LaunchGame.bat** file is provided. The first two variables, ANACONDA_DIR and ENV_NAME may have to be updated for custom Anaconda installation directories and custom Conda environment names (the default is 'yourenvname'). To use this script, launch a command prompt from the Setup_Scripts directory and run:

`$ LaunchGame.bat`

#### MacOS

1. Initialize your conda environment.

`$ conda activate $your_env_name`

2. Edit Unity executable name in **LaunchGame** script.

`PROJECT_NAME="MazeProject"`

3. Run the script.

```
$ cd Setup_Scripts
$ ./LaunchGame
```

4. Deactivate your environment.

`$ conda deactivate`
