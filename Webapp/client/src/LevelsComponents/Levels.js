          Learn how to play the game through guided instructions in our tutorial
          level! Navigate through a simple maze, while being guided with tips on
          how to use our game controls.

        </p>
        <p>
          This "simple" level is actually our hardest level. If you like being
          challenged, we recommend you wander and warp through its empty, barren
          corridors. The hallways look identical, so once you get lost, it's
          unlikely you'll find your way back. Reminiscent of Boelter Hall.

            <b>Difficulty</b>: Medium
          </div>
          <div>
            <b>Environment</b>: Forest featuring trees, hills, and branches to
            jump over/duck under
          </div>
        </p>
        <p>
          If level 0 was too easy for you, and level 1 was too difficult, this
          level will be perfect for you. Navigate through a relaxing nature
          environment, and compete for the best score!

        <h4>Level 3: Snowy Mountain</h4>

            <b>Difficulty</b>: Hard
          </div>
          <div>
            <b>Environment</b>: Snowy mountaintop featuring aesthetic trees,
            fences, and snowmen
          </div>
        </p>
        <p>
          This is our most aesthetic level. It's Christmas-themed, featuring a
          snowy mountaintop aesthetic. The immersive visuals and audio create a
          very enjoyable atmosphere. This level is a must-play.

            <b>Difficulty</b>: Easy
          </div>
          <div>
            <b>Environment</b>: Forest featuring trees, hills, and branches to
            jump over/duck under
          </div>
        </p>
        <p>
          This level is similar to the tutorial level, except it has a relaxing,
          enjoyable forest environment. It's a good level to practice the IMU
          controls and ducking/jumping in your web cam before attempting more
          difficult levels.
